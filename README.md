# Weather App Documentation

This document provides an overview of setting up and running the Weather App, including dependencies and specific instructions.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio) with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather_app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Run the App:**
   ```
   flutter run
   ```
   - This command starts the app in debug mode. Use `-d <device-id>` to specify a device (e.g., web, iOS simulator, Android emulator).

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Flutter structure:

- **`lib/`**: Contains Dart code for the app.
  - **`screens/`**: Screen implementations (`weather_screen.dart`, `splash_screen.dart`, etc.).
  - **`services/`**: Backend services (`weather_provider.dart`, `api_service.dart`, etc.).
  - **`theme/`**: Custom themes and styles (`theme.dart`).
  - **`config.dart`**: Configuration file for API keys and other constants.
- **`assets/`**: Contains static files like images and fonts.

## Dependencies

The app uses the following dependencies:

- **`http`**: For making HTTP requests to fetch weather data.
- **`provider`**: For state management using ChangeNotifierProvider.
- **`flutter_svg`**: For displaying SVG images.
- **`geolocator`**: For obtaining device location.
- **`permission_handler`**: For handling permissions related to location access.
- **`intl`**: For internationalization and localization support.
- **`cupertino_icons`**: Default Flutter icons for iOS style.

These dependencies are specified in `pubspec.yaml` and can be updated as needed.

## Additional Notes

- **Environment Configuration**: For Flutter Web, API keys and configurations are managed directly in the Dart code (`config.dart`). Ensure sensitive information is handled securely.
- **Testing**: The app includes basic unit tests (`flutter_test`), which can be expanded for more comprehensive testing.
- **Deployment**: Follow Flutter's guidelines for building and deploying to different platforms (web, iOS, Android).
